## Description

I created an interactive multi-screen "camera experience" which explores the different seasons by pressing a button, showing the seasons through a "picture", as if the player is scrolling through them. The game uses smooth pacing and calming, simple graphics to invoke emotion to the player. I chose to generate slideshow game that goes through the different seasons to give users a visually and aesthetically-pleasing experiences. I created the game's code using GenAI, using my original prompt/idea generation to come up with the idea of the game.
